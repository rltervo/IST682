# IST687 - Intro Data Science

## Disclaimer:
This material is a represenation of my work for the course IST687 and shows the quality of work I like do.

## Opening Comments:
This was my first Applied Data Science course from Syracuse University.  It was a lot of fun and I learned a lot.

The main topics covered in this course was general knowledge in Data Science, Statistics, programming in R, and how to apply various machine learning algorithms.

## 1. Assignments:
There were  assignments were completed in the program R.  
I learned a lot with these assignments.  Most of these assignments were fairly straightforward.  On interesting exercise was the explainer video assignment.  In the explainer video I had to do a video explaining how to do that week's assignment.  It was a unique opportunity.

## 2. Final Project:   Predict Employee Attrition
Employee attrition is a significant financial burden for companies.  The goal was to analyze employee data to try to accurately predict employees likely to leave the company.  If a model could accurately predict when employees were likely to leave then the company could have an opportunity to intervene.

The six steps of CRISP-DM methodology was used in this exercise.  The six steps include Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Prep, Modeling, Evaluating, and Deployment or Deployment Recommendations.  In addition, the final project was a group project with 5 members, including myself.  

In the project three models were explored.  The Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Treel, and Logistic were compared.  The metric to evaluate the models was 'Correct Yes' Rate, meaning the model could accurately predict when an employee was going to leave the company.  Using this metric Logistic Regression perfromed the best.
