# IST687 - Intro Data Science

## Disclaimer:
The material posted here is a represenation of my work for the course IST687.
It is designed to demonstrate the quality of my work.

## Opening Comments:
This was among the first Applied Data Science courses I took from Syracuse University.  It was a lot of fun and I learned a lot. Truly excellent instructor.

The main topics covered in this course was general knowledge in Data Science, Statistics, programming in R, and how to apply various machine learning algorithms.

In this repository I have posted my prior assignments and final project.  The assignments were completed by myself and the final project was a group assignment.


## 1. Assignments:
Ther assignments were completed in the program R.  
Many of these assignments were fairly straightforward.  On interesting exercise was the explainer video assignment.  In the explainer video I had to do a video explaining how to do that week's assignment.  It was a unique opportunity.

## 2. Final Project:   Predict Employee Attrition
Employee attrition is a significant financial burden for companies.  The goal was to analyze employee data to try to accurately predict employees likely to leave the company.  If a model could accurately predict when employees were likely to leave then the company could have an opportunity to intervene.

The six steps of CRISP-DM methodology was used in this exercise.  The six steps include Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Prep, Modeling, Evaluating, and Deployment or Deployment Recommendations.  In addition, the final project was a group project with 5 members, including myself.  For this project the group dynamics were excellent.  Everyone did there best and had a solid understanding of the material. 
 
In the project three models were explored.  The Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Treel, and Logistic were compared.  The metric to evaluate the models was 'Correct Yes' Rate, meaning the model could accurately predict when an employee was going to leave the company.  Using this metric Logistic Regression perfromed the best. 

*** On a particular highpoint, the course professor said that our final project was the best he had seen in nearly 3 years.

## Closing Remarks:
I enjoyed learning the programming language R.  This was my first introduction to R and I was surprised how easy it was to work with, the syntax is straightforward and intuitive.  The instructor was excellent and created an positive atmosphere.  In all a great course.
