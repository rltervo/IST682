# IST687 - Intro Data Science

## Opening Comments:
This was my first Applied Data Science course from Syracuse University.  It was a lot of fun and I learned a lot.

The main topics covered in this course was general knowledge in Data Science, Statistics, programming in R, and how to apply various machine learning algorithms.

## Assignments:
There were  assignments were completed in the program R.  
I learned a lot with these assignments but I don't believe they are worth a potential reader's time or energy.

## Final Project:   Predict Employee Attrition
Employee attrition is a significant financial burden for companies.  The goal was to analyze employee data to try to accurately predict employees likely to leave the company.  If a company could accurately predict when employees are likely to leave the company that would give the company an opportunity to keep the best talent.

The six steps of CRISP-DM methodology was used in this exercise.  The six steps include Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Prep, Modeling, Evaluating, and Deploying/Recommendations.  In addition, the final project was a group project with 5 members, including myself.  

In the project 4 models were evaluated in which ___ was the best identified.
